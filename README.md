# jutilities

This a collection of convenience functions for data handling, plotting,
and analysis within the `tidyverse` syntax. Most of these functions are
wrappers for tasks I perform regularly (e. g., describe variables, add
mean indices) and wanted to integrate them into `%>%`pipes with just one
line.

## Installation

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("joon-e/jutilities")
```
