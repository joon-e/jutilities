# jutilities

This a collection of convenience functions for data handling, plotting, and analysis within the `tidyverse` syntax. Most of these functions are wrappers for tasks I perform regularly (e. g., describe variables, add mean indices) and wanted to integrate them into `%>%` pipes with just one line.

This is all very much work in progress.

## Installation

Install from GitHub:

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
